# solver
Created a file full_katamino.py The execution doesn't show output with solutions (how it should). 
Based on big.py which took 16 hours to find the all solutions. 
big.py is a shortened version of katamino.

full_katamino has many repeated while statements that can be transformed to something more convinient and pythonic, but I don't know how.
